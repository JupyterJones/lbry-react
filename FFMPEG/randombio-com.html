Example ffmpeg commands

<p>
<span class="firstletter"> <img src="F40gray-gray.png" alt="F" title="F" /></span>
fmpeg is a powerful command-line tool for manipulating video files and movies.
However, the documentation is confusing. Here are some tested commands for 
performing typical tasks.
</p><p>
Normally, you'd do this in Linux, but there's also a Windows version of ffmpeg.
To use it, click the Start button and type <code>cmd.exe</code>, hit Enter, then 
type the commands in the little black command window that pops up. To change
to the different directory or &ldquo;folder&rdquo; in a Windows command box, 
use the <code>cd</code> command. If a filename contains spaces, you have to put 
it in double quotes (usually; the Windows cd command doesn't seem to need them.)

</p><p>
<!--
<b> Caution </b><br />
Later versions of ffmpeg may create files that are unreadable in Windows.
Specifically, I found that .mov files created by the latest ffmpeg (version
2.8.17 aka N-100545-g15baa0c) and the version on Debian 10.5 (4.1.6-1~deb10u1) 
will not play in Windows 7 Media Player, while older ffmpeg versions worked 
fine. It does create readable .avi files. It's recommended to test your version 
and keep the source code around if it works.
</p><p>
Also, the command-line options seem to change routinely. The qscale option 
described below no longer has any effect.

</p><p>
-->
<b> Extract frames from a movie </b><br />
This example extracts the first 2 seconds of a movie in video21.wmv into individual 
image files. The files will be called img-0001.png, img-0002.png, img-0003.png, etc. 
It is best to do this in a separate directory. 
<br /><code> ffmpeg -i video21.wmv -r 30 -t 2 -f image2 img-%04d.png</code>
</p><p>
For wmv files it's sometimes necessary to
specify the frame rate, in this case 30 (-r 30). The parameter '-f image2' means the 
input movie is in "image2" format; normally it's not necessary to specify
it, but if it's not automatically detected, or if the extension is wrong,
it may be needed.
</p><p>
A typical command line would be
<br /><code> ffmpeg -i video21.wmv -f image2 %04d.png</code>
</p>


<p>
<b> Combine individual frames into a movie </b><br />
Create an MP4 movie from JPEG files with filenames 001.jpg, 002.jpg, etc.
This example creates an mp4 with 10 frames per second and 1800 kbps.
<br /><code>ffmpeg -r 10 -b 1800 -i %03d.jpg test.mp4
</code>
<br />
The %3d is 'C' language notation for a 3-digit integer. Don't put a percent 
sign or a 'd' in the filename.

</p><p>
This example creates an mpeg at the default rate (25 fps, 200 kbps). 
<br /><code>
ffmpeg -i %03d.jpg -qscale:v 1 test.mpeg
</code>
<br />
ffmpeg figures out what movie format to use based on the filename extension
that you specify. 
<br />
</p><p>
Sometimes you have to set the bitrate to get a good quality movie. The -b 4000
sets the bit rate to 4000 kbps. In this example, the input filenames must have
names starting with 'frame' followed by a dash, then five digits, then a dot,
then 'jpg'.
<br /><code>  ffmpeg  -b 4000 -i frame-%5d.jpg -qscale:v 1 test.mpeg
</code>
</p><p>
<b> Notes on creating movies</b><br />
</p><p>
1. File names must start with 01, 001, etc. If they start at some other number,
or if they have a prefix (like "img-") ffmpeg won't see them. If there's a missing
number in the sequence, ffmpeg will just stop and create a truncated movie.
</p><p>
2. To get a good quality, it's necessary to use the <code> -qscale 1</code> option.
This gives a variable bitrate but constant quality (1 = good, 31 = bad). Example:
<br /><code>   ffmpeg -i %04d.png -qscale:v 1  test.MOV </code>
</p><p>
Here are the results I got with a test file:<br />
<table summary="table">
<thead> 
   <tr> 
   <th>qscale     &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; </th>
   <th>File size  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; </th>
   <th>Quality     &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; </th>
   </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td> 1 </td> <td> 5826198  </td> <td> OK </td> </tr>
  <tr><td> 2 </td> <td> 5859146  </td> <td> OK </td> </tr>
  <tr><td> 4 </td> <td> 2651676  </td> <td> not too bad </td> </tr>
  <tr><td> 7 </td> <td> 1657662  </td> <td> bad    </td> </tr>
  <tr><td> 10</td> <td> 1341036  </td> <td> blocky </td> </tr>
  <tr><td> 15</td> <td> 1109092  </td> <td> terrible</td> </tr>
  <tr><td> 20</td> <td>  987848  </td> <td> terrible </td> </tr>
  <tr><td> 30</td> <td>  895896  </td> <td> terrible </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
If the filenames aren't in numeric sequence, use this Linux bash script
to rename them:
</p><p>
<code>
# bash file to rename images to numeric filename sequence <br />
  a=1<br />
  for i in *.png; do<br />
     new=$(printf "%04d.png" ${a})<br />
     echo renaming ${i} ${new} <br />
     mv ${i} ${new}<br />
     let a=a+1<br />
  done<br />
</code>

</p><p>
<b> Creating animated GIFs in ffmpeg</b><br />
<code>fmpeg -i %04d.png -s 288x162 test.gif</code>
</p><p>
creates an animated GIF89 format file that's playable on a web browser. 
Set the image size with the -s option to keep the animated file to a reasonable
size. GIF files are only 8 bits/pixel regardless of the pixel depth of the starting
files, so the quality is not very good. The qscale option is ignored. There are 
many options for setting the number of times it loops, and to overlay it on 
another video.
</p><p>
It's often more convenient to do it in 3 steps.
</p><ol><li>
  Create an MPEG movie. This example creates one from a series of images,
  then shrinks it to 288 &times; 162 pixels.<br>
  <code>fmpeg -i %04d.png -s 288x162 test.mp4</code>
</li><li>
  Generate a palette using either the lanczos or dither filter. It creates a small
  palette file in a png image format.<br />
  <code>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -vf scale=900:-1:flags=lanczos,palettegen palette.png</code><br />
  <code>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -vf scale=900:-1:sws_dither=ed,palettegen palette2.png</code><br />
</li><li>
  Convert the mpeg into an animated gif using this rather complicated command.
  <code>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -i palette2.png -filter_complex "fps=30,scale=250:-1:flags=lanczos[x];[x][1:v]paletteuse" test.gif</code>
</li></ol>
<p>
Note that the fps parameter doesn't really change the frame rate. It simply works 
by deleting intermediate frames, rather than slowing the image down. I could get 
none of the other options (<code>-r, -default_delay, -max_gif_delay, 
-min_delay</code>, etc) to work either. The -r drops frames and the 
others have no effect.
</p><p>
The animated GIF file was 206774 bytes, while the MPEG file was 43008 bytes.
</p><p>
GIF is pretty much obsolete, so
it's much better to forget about animated GIF and use the HTML5 video command.<br />
<code>&lt;video width="320" height="240" controls&gt;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"&gt;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your browser does not support the video tag.<br />
 &lt;/video&gt;</code>
</p><p>
In the above HTML, the browser checks each line to see if there's a format it supports.
If not, it prints the last line.
Unfortunately, the default MP4 produced by ffmpeg isn't compatible with HTML5.
Last I checked, getting ffmpeg to compile in Linux with H.264 support was a royal pain.
So, for the time being, I use the old way, which causes the browser to start up
Windows Media Player in Windows, or Mplayer in Linux, or whatever add-on your
browser is set to use. Example:
<br/>
<code>&lt;a href="fireflies/fireflies-cropped.avi"&gt;</code>
</p><p>

<!--
To create one, you need this command:
<code>ffmpeg -i test.mpg -map 0 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy test.mp4</code>

<video width="288" height="162" controls>
<source src="test.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
-->

</p><p>
<b> Changing image file format </b><br />
Sometimes you want to convert the files into JPEGs first. This script will
do the conversion and change the extension of each file from .png to .jpg.
This works in Linux. Note that scripting won't work in Windows unless you 
have a shell like Bash installed.
<br /><code>for f in *png ; do convert -quality 100 $f `basename $f png`jpg; done <br />
</code>

</p><p>
<b> Find what file formats are supported </b><br />
<br /><code>
ffmpeg -formats <br />
man ffmpeg-all<br />
man ffmpeg-formats<br />
man ffmpeg-filters<br />
</code>
</p><p>

<b> Get help </b><br />
<br /><code>
ffmpeg -h
</code>
</p><p>


<b> Convert movie from WMV to mp4 format</b><br />
Ffmpeg determines what file format you want by the extension. If your input file
doesn't have the right extension, bad things will happen.
<br /><code>
ffmpeg -i video04.wmv -f mp4 -strict -2 -t 5 a.mp4
</code>
<br /><code>
ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -strict -2 test.mp4
</code>
</p><p>
It's recommended to use the <code>-qscale 1</code> option whenever possible to 
make sure ffmpeg doesn't compress the result, which can give poor quality. This 
line converts an AVI (RIFF format) file to Apple QuickTime format.
Windows Media Player can't read the AVI files from the later (4.1) versions
of ffmpeg, but has no trouble with the earlier ones.
<br/>
<code>ffmpeg -i 9980.avi -qscale 1 9980-merged.MOV</code>
</p><p>


<b> Resize a movie </b><br />
Resize a movie input.MOV to 640 &times; 480 pixels. A movie file titled 
output.MOV is produced.
<br /><code>
ffmpeg -i input.MOV -vf scale=640:480 output.MOV
</code>
</p><p>


<b> Crop a movie </b><br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i input.MOV -vf crop=100:110:200:80 output.MOV <br />
ffmpeg -i input.MOV -vf crop=in_w:in_h/2:in_w:in_h/2 output.MOV <br />
</code>
<br />
The parameters are x:y:width:height in pixels. The first command tries to create 
a 200&times;80 image, but ffmpeg will change this to the correct movie aspect 
ratio. The second command saves only the bottom half of your movie.
</p><p>


<b> Editing a movie </b><br />
Extract a section out of the movie, saving only the five seconds between 70 and 75
in output.MOV.
<br />
<br /><code>
ffmpeg -i input.MOV -ss 00:01:10 -t 00:00:05  -c:v copy -c:a copy output.MOV 
</code>
<br />
<br />
The <code> -c:v copy -c:a copy </code> option makes it faster by copying the
video and audio instead of decoding and re-encoding them. You could also use 
<code>-vf trim=70:75</code>, but this doesn't re-set the time stamp, so 
viewers will just see a black screen for the first 70 seconds. Supposedly 
the <code>setpts</code> filter can fix this, but I couldn't get it to work.
</p><p>
Another way to copy 12 seconds from a movie starting at 1 minute 15 seconds, 
put in test.MOV:<br/>
<code>ffmpeg -i input.MOV -ss 00:01:15.0 -codec copy -t 12 test.MOV</code>
</p><p>
(Note: In older versions of ffmpeg this command crops a few hundred milliseconds 
from the beginning of the movie. If those are important, upgrade to 4.1 or merge 
the movie with something else first.)

</p><p>
<b> Concatenating two or more movies </b><br />
To merge an arbitrary number video files:<br />
<code>ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy merged.MOV</code>
</p><p>
The list file must have the filenames, one per line, preceded by the word 'file'.
<br/>
<code>
file test01.MOV <br />
file test02.MOV
</code>
</p><p>
Both video and audio tracks are merged.
</p><p>
With this technique, 
I've had trouble with extra unwanted frames showing up in the concatenated movie.
So far, the only way I've been able to get exactly the frames that are needed is
to split the movie into individual image files, delete the bad ones, and create
a new movie from the images. Unfortunately, this eliminates the sound.
</p><p>



<b> Retrieving metadata from a movie </b><br />
Reads metadata and prints it on the screen. As with all ffmpeg commands, 
there are many options (man ffprobe). 
<a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">ExifTool</a> gives
a lot more information.
<br /><code>
ffprobe DSC_6881.MOV

</p>


<p>
<b> Filtering a movie </b><br />
It is possible to split a movie into frames, process each individual frame
in an image analysis program, and then re-assemble it into a movie. But this
gets tedious after the first few hundred thousand frames.
</p><p>
Brightening, changing the gamma, inverting, and many other functions are
available in ffmpeg through the filter option. Filtering uses the -vf option 
followed by a series of commands. They can be very simple, but don't forget
the -qscale 1 option or you'll get garbage.

<br />
<br />
To resize a movie to 320  &times; 240 pixels:
<br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i input.MOV -vf scale=320:240 -qscale 1 output.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />

To invert the colors in a movie:
<br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf lutrgb="r=negval:g=negval:b=negval" -qscale 1 output3.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />

To increase brightness by a factor of four:
<br />
<code>
 ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf lutyuv=y=val*4 -qscale 1 output3.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />


To lighten a movie while reducing the contrast:
<br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i DSC_2650.MOV -vf lutyuv=y=val+30 -qscale 1 DSC-2650a.mov
</code>
<br />
<br />


To increase red by a factor of two:
<br />
<code>
 ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf lutrgb=r=val*2 -qscale 1 output3.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />


To increase gamma by factor of 5:
<br />
<code>
 ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf 'lutyuv=y=gammaval(0.2)' -qscale 1  output3.MOV
</code>
<br />
Single quotes are needed to prevent the shell from messing with the command
because it contains parentheses.
<br />
<br />


To rotate a movie by 45 degrees:
<br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf rotate=45 -qscale 1 output3.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />


The sharpen, blur, or sharpen a movie (-qscale 1 is omitted for clarity):
<br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf unsharp  output3.MOV <br/>
ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf unsharp=7:7:-2:7:7:-2  output3.MOV <br/>
ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf unsharp=5:5:1.5:5:5:0.0  output3.MOV 
</code>
<br />
<br />
The defaults for unsharp are 5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0.<br />
1st = kernel of luma filter x size (odd 3 to 63)<br />
2nd = kernel of luma filter y size (odd 3 to 63)<br />
3rd = amount of luma filtering  (&minus;1.5 to 1.5 but can be any number); negative=blur, positive=sharpen<br />
4th = kernel of chroma filter x size (odd 3 to 63)<br />
5th = kernel of chroma filter y size (odd 3 to 63)<br />
6th = amount of chroma filtering  (&minus;1.5 to 1.5 but can be any number); negative=blur, positive=sharpen<br />

<br />



To draw a box or grid on the movie:
<br />
<code>
 ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf drawbox=x=10:y=20:w=200:h=60:color=red@0.5  output3.MOV
<br />
<br />
 ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf drawgrid=width=100:height=100:thickness=2:color=red@0.5  output3.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />




</p>
<p>
<b> More complex filters </b><br />
Filters can also be very complex. Many seemingly simple operations require splitting 
the processing stream. This example crops and flips half of the image. 
This information is from the man page (<code>man ffmpeg-filters</code>).
</p>
<pre>               [main]
     input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
                 |                             ^
                 |[tmp]                  [flip]|
                 +-----> crop --> vflip -------+
</pre>
<p>
The input is split into two streams. One stream goes through the
crop filter and the vflip filter, and is then merged back with the 
other stream by overlaying it on top. The start and end of each path
require labels enclosed in square brackets. All these commands go on a
single line, not broken up as shown here.
</p>
<code>
ffmpeg -i inputmovie -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" outputmovie
</code>
<br />
<br />
<p>
Here are some examples of filtering. The first one uses the YUV look-up table filter to 
multiply the luminance by a factor of 5, which can be useful for making extremely dark 
images brighter. There are also commands for changing the gamma and contrast.
</p><p>
<code>
ffmpeg -i DSC_6881.MOV -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] lutyuv="y=val*5" [tmp2]; [main][tmp2] overlay"  output.MOV
</code>




</p><p>
This example raises the gamma. In ffmpeg, a value less than 1.0 makes dark areas 
lighter and a value above 1.0 makes them darker, which is the opposite of what
you'd expect:
<br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i DSC_6881.MOV -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] lutyuv=y=gammaval(0.6) [tmp2]; [main][tmp2] overlay" output.MOV
</code>

</p><p>
The RGB look-up table filter is similar, and allows you to do stuff to the
red, green, and blue channels separately. In this case we invert them to make
a negative image.
</p><p>
<code>
ffmpeg -i DSC_6887.MOV -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] lutrgb="r=negval:g=negval:b=negval" [tmp2]; [main][tmp2] overlay"  output.MOV
</code>

</p><p>
This example denoises a movie file. This helps reduce those rectangular compression 
artifacts.
<br />
<code>
ffmpeg -i output2.MOV -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] dctdnoiz=4.5 [tmp2]; [main][tmp2] overlay" output3.MOV
</code>

</p><p>
There are numerous other options, such as deshake, delogo, drawtext, fade,
lens correction, rotate, subtitles, and fft filter. Some I could get to work and some,
like drawtext, I couldn't, and some take a very long time to run. 


</p><p>
<b> Combining filters </b><br />
You can put many filters together in the same command. The following rules apply:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the filter takes more than one parameter, separate parameters by colons.
Ex: <code> unsharp=7:7:-2:7:7:-2 </code>
</li><li>
To put two or more filters together, separate them by commas. But watch out:
spaces are not allowed. If you use spaces, the whole thing has to be inside
quotes.
<br />
<br />
Bad:<br />
<code> 
ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=480:270, lutyuv=y=val*4, lutyuv=y=gammaval'(2.0)' output2.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />
Good: <br />
<code> 
ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf "scale=480:270, lutyuv=y=val*4, lutyuv=y=gammaval(2.0)" output2.MOV
</code>
<br />
<br />
Good: <br />
<code> ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=480:270,lutyuv=y=val*4,lutyuv=y=gammaval'(2.0)' output2.MOV
</code>
</li><li>
If a filter contains '(', ')', ';' or some other command that's used by the shell,
you have to enclose it in single or double quotes.
</li><li>
If you use the wrong syntax, it will print an error message. Pay no attention to 
what it says&mdash;it is often wrong.
</li>
</ul>
