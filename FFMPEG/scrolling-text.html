'1900 OR THE LAST PRESIDENT 
BY INGERSOLL LOCKWOOD
Copyright, 1896, by Ikgersoll Lockwood. 
CHAPTER I. 
That was a terrible night for the great City of 
New York the night of Tuesday, November 3rd, 
1896. The city staggered under the blow like a huge 
ocean liner which plunges, full speed, with terrific 
crash into a mighty iceberg, and recoils shattered 
and trembling like an aspen. 
The people were gathered, light-hearted and con- 
fident, at the evening meal, when the news burst 
upon them. It was like a thunder bolt out of an 
azure sky. Altgeld holds Illinois hard and fast in 
the Democratic line. This elects Bryan President of 
the United States. 
Strange to say, the people in the upper portion of 
the city made no movement to rush out of their 
houses and collect in the public squares, although the 
night was clear and beautiful. They sat as if paral- 
yzed with a nameless dread, and when they con- 
versed it was with bated breath and throbbing 
hearts. 
In less than half an hour, mounted policemen 
dashed through the streets calling out Keep 
within your houses close your doors and barricade 
them. The entire East side is in a state of uproar. 
Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of 
Anarchists and Socialists, and threaten to plunder 
and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged 
and oppressed them for so many years. Keep within 
doors. Extinguish all lights. 
Happily, Governor Morton was in town, and al- 
though a deeper palor overcame the ashen hue of 
age as he spoke, yet there was no tremor in his voice 
Let the Seventh, Twenty-second, and Seventy-first 
regiments be ordered under arms. In a few moments
hundreds of messengers could be heard racing 
through the silent streets, summoning the members 
of these regiments to their Armories. 
Slowly, but with astonishing nerve and steadiness, 
the mobs pushed the police northward, and although 
the force stood the onslaught with magnificent cour- 
age, yet beaten back, the dark masses of infuriated 
beings surged up again with renewed fury and 
strength. Will the troops be in time to save the 
city ? was the whispered inquiry among the knots of 
police officials who were directing the movements of 
their men.' \
