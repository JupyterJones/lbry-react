Run the command ./lbry_search.js
the trailing one is what page to start searching on.
Notice the results showing the search started on: "page": 1
The page size by default is 20 pages: "page_size": 20
There is a total amount of items listed: "total_items": 1000
( notice that 50 pages x 20 items per page equals 1000 )
the first 20 items are listed in covid.txt.
( files are names the same as the search term )
  
 if the command $ ./lbry_search.js 2 is used the second 20 items will be
appended to the file covid.txt.
