tips:
If the  training loss is much lower than validation loss
the network is probably overfitting. if this is the case, decrease your network size,
or to increase dropout.You could try dropout of 0.5 (experiment).

If the training loss and validation loss are about the same your model is underfitting.
Increase the size of your model (either number of layers or the raw number of neurons
per layer)
